1. Vulnerability Overview
CVE-2025-32711, publicly known as EchoLeak, is a critical zero-click AI command injection vulnerability affecting Microsoft 365 Copilot. This vulnerability enables unauthorized attackers to remotely exfiltrate sensitive organizational data without any user interaction through specially crafted prompt injections .

1.1 Basic CVE Information
CVE ID: CVE-2025-32711

Alias: EchoLeak

Publication Date: June 11, 2025

Last Modified: August 4, 2025

Vulnerability Type: AI Command Injection (CWE-77) 

Affected Product: Microsoft 365 Copilot 

1.2 Technical Classification
This vulnerability represents a novel attack class categorized as LLM Scope Violation, where untrusted external input improperly influences the AI model to access and disclose privileged internal information beyond its intended security boundaries .

1.3 Severity Scoring
Source	CVSS Score	Severity	Vector
Microsoft	9.3	CRITICAL	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:L/A:N 
NVD	7.5	HIGH	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N 
2. Technical Analysis
2.1 Vulnerability Mechanism
EchoLeak exploits Microsoft 365 Copilot's Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architecture, which combines GPT-based language models with organizational data sources including emails, OneDrive files, SharePoint content, and Teams messages . The vulnerability stems from improper neutralization of special elements used in commands, allowing malicious prompts embedded in seemingly benign documents to execute unauthorized actions .

2.2 Attack Vector & Exploitation
The exploitation follows a sophisticated multi-stage process:

Initial Compromise: Attackers deliver a malicious payload through ordinary business documents (Word, PowerPoint, Outlook emails) containing hidden prompt injections . These injections are concealed using various techniques:

Hidden text, comments, or speaker notes

White-on-white text invisible to human users

HTML comments within email bodies

Metadata fields 

Trigger Mechanism: When a user later interacts with Copilot for legitimate tasks (e.g., "Summarize this presentation"), Copilot's RAG engine retrieves the malicious document as context .

LLM Scope Violation: The hidden instructions execute within Copilot's processing context, commanding it to:

Extract sensitive information from accessible data sources

Format the stolen data into exfiltration-ready output

Conceal the malicious source in its response 

Data Exfiltration: The stolen data is embedded in automatically-loading image references using Markdown formatting, enabling zero-click exfiltration to attacker-controlled servers .

2.3 Exploitation Techniques & Bypasses
The EchoLeak attack chain successfully circumvented multiple security layers:

XPIA Classifier Bypass: Attackers crafted prompts that appeared as legitimate human instructions rather than AI commands, evading Microsoft's Cross-Prompt Injection Attack classifiers .

External Link Redaction Bypass: Using reference-style Markdown links ([text][1] with separate [1]: URL definitions) that Copilot's filters didn't recognize as external links .

Content Security Policy Bypass: Leveraging trusted Microsoft domains (SharePoint, Teams) as proxies to bypass CSP restrictions .

RAG Spraying: Sending multiple emails covering varied topics to increase likelihood of retrieval during user queries .

3. Impact Assessment
3.1 Potential Consequences
The exploitation of CVE-2025-32711 could lead to:

Mass Data Exfiltration: Unauthorized access to emails, chat logs, documents, and other sensitive organizational data within Copilot's scope .

Zero-Click Exploitation: Complete attack execution without any user interaction, making traditional security awareness ineffective .

Cross-Platform Compromise: Functionality across Word, PowerPoint, Outlook, and Teams .

Stealth Operation: No malware signatures, unusual logs, or traditional indicators of compromise .

3.2 Real-World Attack Scenario
Consider this hypothetical exploitation:

An attacker sends a seemingly benign "Q3 Strategy Update" presentation containing hidden prompt injections. When a manager asks Copilot to "provide a quick overview," Copilot responds with confidential information including acquisition targets, layoff plans, and executive communications, while simultaneously exfiltrating this data to attacker-controlled servers via automatically-loaded images .

4. Mitigation & Response
4.1 Microsoft's Response
Microsoft addressed CVE-2025-32711 through comprehensive server-side patches deployed in May/June 2025 . Key aspects of their response include:

No Customer Action Required: The fix was implemented entirely on Microsoft's infrastructure .

Enhanced Protections: Strengthened XPIA classifiers, link redaction mechanisms, and content security policies .

Additional Hardening: Defense-in-depth measures to prevent similar exploitation patterns .

4.2 Organizational Security Measures
While Microsoft's patch resolves the immediate vulnerability, organizations should implement these security enhancements:

Configuration Recommendations
Audit Copilot Access: Review and restrict Copilot permissions for sensitive data and users .

Disable External Email Context: Configure Copilot to exclude external email content from processing .

Implement Data Loss Prevention: Apply sensitivity labels to prevent Copilot from processing restricted content .

Restrict Markdown Rendering: Limit Copilot's ability to render Markdown content that could contain exfiltration mechanisms .

Proactive Security Controls
AI-Specific Monitoring: Deploy specialized monitoring for anomalous Copilot behavior and outputs .

Data Sanitization: Implement tools to strip hidden text, metadata, and comments from shared documents .

Network Security: Monitor for unexpected outbound connections, particularly to unfamiliar domains .

Employee Education: Develop security awareness around AI-specific threats and prompt injection risks .

5. Broader Implications & Lessons Learned
5.1 AI Security Landscape
EchoLeak represents a significant evolution in the vulnerability landscape, demonstrating several critical trends:

New Attack Surface: AI integrations create previously non-existent attack vectors that bypass traditional security controls .

Language-Based Attacks: Malicious payloads executed entirely through natural language bypass signature-based detection .

Architectural Challenges: RAG systems face fundamental security challenges in maintaining proper trust boundaries between external content and internal data .

5.2 Future Security Considerations
Based on the EchoLeak case study, organizations should prioritize these security initiatives:

Zero-Trust for AI Systems: Apply least-privilege principles to AI data access, avoiding overpermissioning .

Comprehensive Testing: Include prompt injection scenarios in security assessments and red team exercises .

AI-Specific Frameworks: Adopt established frameworks like OWASP Top 10 for LLM Applications to guide security strategies .

Multi-Layered Defense: Combine input sanitization, runtime monitoring, output filtering, and access controls for comprehensive protection .
