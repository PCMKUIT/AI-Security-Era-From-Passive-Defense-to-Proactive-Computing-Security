## 🔎 CVSS v4.0 Score Breakdown

The medium severity reflects the requirement for **local access** and **low privileges**, which significantly limits the attack surface compared to network-based threats.

### CVSS Vector String

CVSS:4.0/AV:L/AC:L/AT:N/PR:L/UI:N/VC:N/VI:N/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N/AU:N/R:U/V:D/RE:M/U:Amber

### Exploitability Metrics

| Metric | Value | Interpretation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Attack Vector (AV)** | Local (L) | Requires physical or logical access to the system. |
| **Attack Complexity (AC)** | Low (L) | Simple, straightforward exploitation techniques. |
| **Privileges Required (PR)** | Low (L) | Requires basic authenticated user access. |

### Impact Assessment

The impact is singularly focused on service disruption:

* **Availability (VA:H):** High impact, resulting in **significant service disruption**, system instability, or temporary unavailability of critical functions.
* **Confidentiality (VC:N) & Integrity (VI:N):** **No impact** on data disclosure or unauthorized data modification.

## 💡 Technical Characteristics & Risk Management

### Vulnerability Details
This vulnerability exhibits characteristics of resource management issues within local system components. Possible scenarios include **Local Denial of Service** or **Resource Exhaustion**, where an authenticated user consumes system resources to degrade performance or trigger instability.

### Remediation Priority
Given the **Medium severity (6.8)** and the **Local (AV:L)** nature of the attack, the vulnerability should be addressed through **planned maintenance windows** and **normal patch management cycles**.

#### Recommended Actions:
1.  **Planned Patching:** Integrate the fix into the organization's standard deployment timelines.
2.  **Access Review:** Enforce the **Principle of Least Privilege** for local user accounts to mitigate potential abuse.
3.  **System Monitoring:** Enhance monitoring for unusual local system behavior indicating resource exhaustion.
