## 🔎 CVSS v3.1 Score Breakdown

The vulnerability is assigned the highest severity score due to its ease of exploitation and devastating impact across all foundational security principles.

### CVSS Vector String
CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

### Exploitability Metrics

The combination of `AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N` confirms an attacker-friendly scenario:
* **Remote Exploitation (AV:N):** The vulnerability can be exploited globally over the network.
* **Low Barrier (AC:L, PR:N, UI:N):** No special privileges, complex sequences, or user interaction are required for a successful attack.

### Impact Assessment

A successful attack results in total compromise of the host system:
* **Confidentiality (C:H):** Total information disclosure (access to all sensitive data).
* **Integrity (I:H):** Total data integrity compromise (ability to modify or delete all data).
* **Availability (A:H):** Complete loss of system availability (Denial of Service).

## 🎯 Vulnerability Mechanism (Prompt Injection)

The core issue is a **Prompt Injection vulnerability** in PandasAI's interactive function.

1.  **Intent:** The function is designed to interpret natural language queries for data analysis.
2.  **Exploit:** Malicious actors craft inputs that bypass the intended security controls and inject **arbitrary Python code**.
3.  **Result:** The injected code is executed with the privileges of the PandasAI application, leading to a complete system compromise.

## 🛡️ Immediate Remediation Guidance

Given the Critical severity, **immediate security response is required.**

### Recommended Mitigation Strategies:

1.  **Isolation:** Immediately segregate affected systems from public/untrusted network access.
2.  **Strict Input Validation:** Implement rigorous input filtering and sanitization for all data processed by PandasAI prompts, specifically rejecting known executable code patterns.
3.  **Least Privilege:** Ensure the PandasAI process operates with the **absolute minimum necessary permissions** to limit the scope of RCE upon successful exploitation.
4.  **Enhanced Monitoring:** Deploy aggressive monitoring to detect potential exploitation attempts and unusual code execution.
