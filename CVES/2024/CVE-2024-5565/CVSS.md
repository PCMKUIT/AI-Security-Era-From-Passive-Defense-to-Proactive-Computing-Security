## 🔎 CVSS v3.1 Score Breakdown

The vulnerability achieves a High severity rating due to the complete system impact, moderated slightly by the High Attack Complexity.

### CVSS Vector String

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

### Exploitability Metrics Analysis

The exploitability metrics highlight a scenario that requires specific effort:
* **Remote Exploitation (AV:N):** The vulnerability is exposed through network-accessible interfaces, significantly broadening the attack surface.
* **High Complexity (AC:H):** Successful exploitation **requires complex conditions, specific knowledge**, or multi-stage attacks, providing some natural defense against opportunistic threats.
* **No Authentication (PR:N, UI:N):** The attacker needs no privileges or user interaction to attempt the exploit.

### Impact Assessment

A successful attack results in catastrophic consequences across all security domains:
* **Confidentiality (C:H):** Total information disclosure.
* **Integrity (I:H):** Complete data integrity compromise (unauthorized modification/deletion).
* **Availability (A:H):** Complete loss of system availability (Denial of Service).

## 🎯 Vulnerability Mechanism (Prompt Injection)

This vulnerability is a prime example of an **AI-Native Threat**, where the model's logic processing is exploited:

* **Vulnerability:** The Vanna.AI interactive function, particularly when handling the "visualize" feature, improperly processes user input.
* **Mechanism:** Malicious **Prompt Injection** bypasses intended controls, tricking the system into executing arbitrary code (RCE) with the application's privileges.
* **Impact:** The exploit leverages a linguistic vulnerability (Prompt Injection) to achieve a maximum technical impact (RCE).

## 🛡️ Immediate Remediation Guidance

Given the High severity and devastating potential impact, **prompt security response is required.**

### Recommended Mitigation Strategies:

1.  **Network Segmentation:** Isolate affected systems and implement **strict network access controls** (e.g., firewalling, least privilege) to limit exposure.
2.  **Monitoring Enhancement:** Increase monitoring sensitivity for **unusual query patterns** or execution attempts related to Vanna.AI's processes.
3.  **Compensating Controls:** Implement **Web Application Firewalls (WAF)** or other controls to filter malicious inputs, despite the complexity of Prompt Injection.
4.  **Patch Management:** Actively monitor vendor communications for official patches or remediation steps.
